## About Me 🚀

I'm a passionate front end programmer and currently a 2nd semester student at Politeknik IDN. I specialize in creating responsive and user-friendly web applications using modern technologies.

My journey in programming began with a curiosity about how websites work, which led me to pursue formal education in this field. I'm constantly learning and improving my skills to stay updated with the latest web development trends.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, and sharing my knowledge with fellow developers.
